### Week 1: Sentiment in text

The first step in understanding sentiment in text, and in particular when training a neural network to do so is the tokenization of that text. </br

This is the process of converting the text into numeric values, with a number representing a word or a character. </br>

This week you'll learn about the Tokenizer and `pad_sequences` APIs in TensorFlow and how they can be used to prepare and encode text and sentences to get them ready for training neural networks!
